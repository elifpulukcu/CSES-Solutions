   Problem: Concert Tickets

   Description:
   There are n ticket prices for a concert and m customers. Each customer will pay up to 
   a maximum amount t for a ticket. For each customer (in the given order), we need to find 
   the ticket with the greatest price that does not exceed t. If such a ticket exists, 
   print its price and remove it from the pool; otherwise, print -1.

   Approach:
   1. Read n (number of tickets) and m (number of customers).
   2. Insert the n ticket prices into a multiset (allowing duplicates).
   3. For each of the m customers:
      - Let t be the maximum price the customer will pay.
      - Use tickets.upper_bound(t) to find the first element greater than t.
      - If upper_bound(t) == tickets.begin(), there is no ticket <= t â‡’ print -1.
      - Otherwise, decrement the iterator to get the ticket <= t, print it, and remove it from the set.
   4. Continue until all customers are processed.

   Time Complexity:
   O((n + m) * log n).
   - Inserting n tickets into a multiset takes O(n log n).
   - For each of the m queries, upper_bound and erase operations each take O(log n).

   Space Complexity:
   O(n), since we store n ticket prices in the multiset.
