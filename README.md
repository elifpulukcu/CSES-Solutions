# CSES Solutions

**Objective:**  

Starting in the final days of 2024, I have decided to embark on a year-long challenge throughout 2025 to consistently practice algorithmic problem-solving by working through the entire [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/). Although my professional responsibilities typically revolve around another programming language, I have chosen C++ for this initiative to maintain and refine my proficiency, as well as to leverage the languageâ€™s extensive ecosystem in the context of competitive programming.

**Approach:**  
- **Duration:** Spreading the 300 problems over the 2025 calendar year, aiming for steady, incremental progress each day.
- **Language:** C++ for all solutions, to maintain and refine problem-solving techniques and memory of standard libraries, as well as to keep a strong connection to my academic foundations.
- **Repository Structure:**  
  - Each problem will have its own `.cpp` file under the relevant category directory (e.g., `Introductory-Problems`, `Sorting-and-Searching`, etc.).
  - A `.gitignore` file is included to exclude compiled binaries, ensuring only source code is tracked.
  - This `README` will be updated as I progress, and a table of contents or summary section may be added later to track completed tasks.

**Contact & Discussion:**  
I am open to discussions, suggestions, and constructive feedback on the solutions. If you would like to discuss a particular problem, approach, or optimization, feel free to reach out.
