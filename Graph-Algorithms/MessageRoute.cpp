    Problem: Message Route

    Description:
    We have an undirected graph with n vertices (labeled 1 to n) and m edges.
    We need to find a path from vertex 1 (Uolevi's computer) to vertex n (Maija's computer).
    If such a path exists, we should output the minimum number of computers on that path 
    (including both endpoints), followed by one example of such a route. 
    If no path exists, print "IMPOSSIBLE".

    Approach (BFS):
    1. Read n (number of vertices) and m (number of edges).
    2. Build an adjacency list (adj) of size n+1 to store the graph.
    3. Create a visited array and a parentArr array, both of size n+1, initialized appropriately.
    4. Perform a BFS starting from node 1:
       - Mark node 1 as visited and enqueue it.
       - While the queue is not empty:
          - Dequeue the front node u.
          - If u == n, we can stop BFS early because weâ€™ve reached the destination.
          - Otherwise, for each neighbor v of u, 
            if it is not visited, mark it visited, record u as its parent, and enqueue v.
    5. After BFS, if node n is not visited, print "IMPOSSIBLE".
       Otherwise, reconstruct the path by following parentArr[] from n backward until -1.
       Reverse that path, and print its length and the nodes in order.

    Time Complexity:
    O(n + m)
    We do a BFS once, which visits each vertex and edge at most once.

    Space Complexity:
    O(n + m)
    We store the graph in an adjacency list and use arrays of size n+1 for visited and parentArr.

    Note:
    - The BFS ensures the path found from 1 to n is of shortest length in terms of number of edges.
